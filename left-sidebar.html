											<b>Business submission: by Vrund Verma, an Indian Business student.</b>
											<br> 
											"My first language is French, so correcting the quality of my english was very necessary. Thanks to this service developed by a native student, it was corrected quickly and very well, $5 for a good nights sleep! Really nice initiative to help other  international students during their exchange! Un grand merci!"-Vrund Verma, an Indian Business student currently still on exchange in Singapore from Warwick University in the UK. Vrund required some extra help in his 4000 word submission. Studying already in the UK, it was evident that he didnt need much help from us as his grammar was near flawless. There were however some mistakes and improvements that we thought could improve the work. Vrund thought so too. The service cost Vrund $7 and was completed within 22 hours.

											<b>Legal Essay: by Edouard Dirven, a Belgian Law student.</b>
											<br> 
											"My first language is French, so correcting the quality of my english was very necessary. Thanks to this service developed by a native student, it was corrected quickly and very well, $5 for a good nights sleep! Really nice initiative to help other  international students during their exchange! Un grand merci!"-Edouard Dirven, a Belgian law student who was on exchange in Singapore. He required help in checking through a 2000 word European Union Law essay. The service cost Edouard $5 and was completed within 6 hours.

											<b>Biotechnology journal submission: by Lena Immswich, a German Masters student in Biochemistry.</b>
											<br> 
											"WOW sehr gut"-Lena Immswich. Lena was studying on exchange in Singapore for one semester away from her home university in Stockholm. Being a science student, as well as a non-native speaker, Lena emailed us worried as to the quality of her written assignment, a format she had grown unfamiliar to. We did our work and Lena recieved an A+ in her submission. Granted that was due to the sophistication of the content of her work, but Lena kindly emailed us later to grant us some credit. The service cost Lena $4 for the 1500 words and was completed within 8 hours.
